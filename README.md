# Vehicle_violation_detection

Using YOLOv5 and Tracking to identify and track vehicles that violate parking regulations, you can set the duration of prohibited parking, and if the parking duration exceeds, an alarm will be triggered. You can save photos and warning information JSON files of the vehicles that violate parking regulations, detect and recognize the license plates of the vehicles that violate parking regulations, and also transmit the detected information through post format, with image information transmitted in base64 format. The alarm cycle, detection area, weekly detection time, and interval time of detection frames can be customized for alerts.
